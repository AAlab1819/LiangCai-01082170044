Sotring Method Used: *Pancake Sort*
Pancake Sort is a sorting method that take the highest number from an array, swap that highest number to index 0 and flip the array.\
This 'flipping' will make the highest number go to the end of the array (which is correct).

Now, let's explore the problem solving side of this problem.\
I basically checked whether there are non-zero triplets (1 1 1) or (3 3 3) in the array.\
If there is a non-zero triplet, output -1 by assigning -1 to ongoing_calls (for more information look at my submission code) and breaking the loop.\
If there is none, the loops continues and for every pair found, increment ongoing_calls by one.\
Finally, output ongoing_calls
